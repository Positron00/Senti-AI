# Senti-AI
This repo contains code for sentiment analysis of customer reviews.

A dataset of customer reviews is selected for a product. The task is to build a machine-learning model to classify whether a review is positive or negative.  Below are the sub-tasks.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

  Load the dataset.
  Perform some exploratory data analysis on the dataset, such as calculating summary statistics, plotting histograms, and checking for missing values.
  Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
  Visualize the distribution of review lengths and sentiment.

2. Text Preprocessing:

  Clean the text data (remove punctuation, stop words, etc.).
  Apply some preprocessing techniques to the data, such as scaling, encoding, and imputation.

3. Model Building:

  Split the data into training and testing sets.
  Choose a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine).
  Train the model on the training data.

4. Evaluation:

  Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
  Compare the results of the models and explain which one performs the best and why.

5. Additional:

  Utilize RAG to query the customer reviews via an LLM
  Apply some techniques to improve the performance of the best model, such as hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or regularization.
  Add comments to the code explaining the logic and choices.
  Implement a more complex model or feature engineering.
  Perform hyperparameter tuning.
